# IST 652: Scripting for Data Science

<!-- Class and Project Description
  The Scripting for Data Science class, taught by Debbie Landowskie, provided
the skillset and tools necessary for data wrangling and analysis. Python and MongoDB were used to build pipelines, acquire data, clean and transform data, build databases, analyze patterns, and create visualizations. Many of the assignments in this class focus on increasing programming knowledge with Python. The early assignments teach conditionals, functions and data importation from various sources. In the middle of the course, stacking and merging are taught in order to familiarize students with transforming data. Later on, MongoDB is used to store data and teach the fundamentals of database functionality. The project created in this class combines these areas of data science by extracting and analyzing CEO twitter data.
  The goal of the project for this class was to gather tweets from various
CEOs, save them to a local MongoDB database, and run a sentiment analysis for each one. The business question being asked was, what are the sentiment scores for each of the CEOs on a given day? The sentiment score has to do with the tone of the text or whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral. These values are determined based on the number of weighted emotional words included in the document. Most of the data for the project came from Twitter while the top CEO twitter handles were extracted from ceoworld.biz. Once extracted, the top handles were saved to a list. A function was created to extract the most recent tweets for each of the CEOs saved to this list. These tweets were then saved as a Python dictionary with the dates, CEOs, and tweets printed out. Once in this format, the dictionary was saved to a MongoDB database where it could be queried later. Using the NLTK package, the text for each of the CEO tweets were tokenized into words. Word clouds were generated to create a unique visualization of word frequencies for each of the CEOs. Once tokenized, the text blob package was used to retrieve the sentiment score for each of the CEOs. Though out of scope, the intention for this project had been to return a sentiment score for a CEO on a given date to determine the impact on their stocks. Assuming their companies are public, a sentiment score that exceeds a certain positive or negative threshold may directly impact the value of their stocks.  

Learning Objectives
  This class focuses on a general overview and the broad practice areas of data
science through scripting in Python, from accessing/transforming data to defining patterns within the data. The project highlights the differing types of data to be extracted. Using OAuth access keys to connect information through a private account is a common practice for extracting data. Sites like Google, Facebook, and Twitter all require this kind of connection. In addition, the ability to transform data into lists and dictionaries are essential for storing, analyzing, and communicating through APIs. Understanding the fundamentals of programming through Python give students the knowledge and tools to apply data science concepts. The project builds an understanding of programming logic and the use of Python packages. Packages like NLTK, Matplotlib, Beautiful Soup, Tweepy, and Text Blob all have practicality in the real world. By acquiring sentiment scores daily for each of these business leaders, market predictions can be made, and actions can be taken. This exemplifies areas of statistics including descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive.
